# Bash Commands CheatSheet

Here's a cheatsheet I'm using to remember some of the most common `bash` commands. 

### Headers

Use `#` symbols in front of text to denote headers. Use up to 6 `#` keys, indicating h1 - h6.

### Italics
Surround text with `*` or `_` to make text _italic_. 

### Bold
Use `**` to **bold** text.

### Strikethrough
Wrap words in 2 `~~` pairings to put a ~~strike~~ through the word.

### Unordered Lists
Start a line with `*`, `-`, or `+` to
* create a 
* bulleted item.
    * Indent and use `*` to make
    * a sub-item.

### Ordered Lists
Start a line with `1.` to make a list. 
1. The system will automatically
1. increase numbers for each additional line.
    1. Indent and use `1.` to add an ordered
    1. sub-item

### Images
Use the following format to indicate an image: `![Alt Text](url)`

### Links
Add links with the following format: `[Linked Text](url)`

### Blocked Quotes
Create block quotes by starting 
> each line with the
> '>' character

### In-line Code
Create in-line code by with `<addr>`.

### Task Lists
- [x] This is a complete item
- [] This is an incomplete item

### Tables 
Create a table by listing words by placing `-` characters beneath the header line and separating columns with `|`. For example:

Header 1 | Header 2
-------- | --------
Cell 1A  | Cell 2A
Cell 1B  | Cell 2B

### Horizontal Lines
Add horizontal lines 
*** 
using `***`, `---`, or `___`
---
on a line by themselves.
